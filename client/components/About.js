          <span>I like creating things that are useful beyond their visual appeal and meaningful enough to genuinely impact peopleâ€™s lives. I also like user interfaces. And data presentation. Mostly, developing experiences that are unique and complementary to natural human behavior. Here are some other things I like: football, basketball, stand-up comedy and podcasts.</span>
